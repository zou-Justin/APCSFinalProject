Brief Description: This will be a recreation of the classic board game, chess. It will have all of the pieces and the board. There will be complete functionality for two players to play a game. Players will click on a piece and then on the square they want to move it to. Illegal moves will not be allowed. The program will recognize check, checkmate, and drawn positions.


Development Log:

Justin 5/25/2021:
Worked on displaying the board, displaying all the pieces and finding the sprites

Adam 5/25/21:
Worked on building the basics of the board and piece classes. Created the shapes/colors for the board

Adam 5/26/21:

Justin 5/26/2021:
Worked a bit on trying to figure out movement and how it would work

Figured out how to select pieces and define eligible squares. Created basic movement mechanism. Designed the basic pawn movement (no promotion or en passant) and the rook movement.

Finished basic movement for all of the pieces.

Justin 5/28/2021
Fixed up castling, worked on a color indicator for turns, and worked a bit on checked.

Adam 5/29/21:
Made it so you can't move when your king is in check and you can't put your king into check.

Justin 5/29/2021:
Made it so the pawn can choose what to promote to as well as trying to find a fix for the castle and check.
